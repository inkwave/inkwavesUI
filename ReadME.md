# This is the read me file where all the needed info about the project will be provided

### doc directory
is for storing the documentation files about the project
### assets directory 
is for storing all the assets, js, css and media files
### pages directory
is for storing all the HTML pages except for the main index entry point

// Common HTML parts like header, navbar, sign modal, footer are created dynamically using JavaScript in a separate file or files along with their functionalities, then
this file or files linked to each html file requires those parts
This way I have avoided the static insert of the same markup for each part of them into each html file, also repeating the same javascript code for all of them in each js script related
to this new html file.
### this is perfect
